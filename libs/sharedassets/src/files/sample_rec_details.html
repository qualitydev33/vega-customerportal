<p class=MsoNormal>Public Cloud Providers provide an abundance for resource
families and sizes curated to meet the needs of modern engineering teams. The
overabundance of options can often lead to resources being over provisioned, or
even when properly utilized there may be an option available that provides
better performance for less, this is the case with most generational or
processor refreshes.<br>
<br>
Vega analyses your usage, CPU, and Memory utilization over a 30 day period to
provide multiple options to allow end users to select the resource type best
suited for their needs, while driving cost savings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>If you agree to this
recommendation, Vega will perform these actions:</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Generation Update</b> - These are traditional generation
updates, recommend migrating current resources from an older generation to the
latest.<br>
<b>Right Sizing</b> - Traditional right sizing looks at downsizing an instance
to more effectively utilize available Memory and CPU.<br>
<b>Processor Refresh</b> - Looks at migrating off of Intel to the cheaper
processor types of Graviton or AMD based on the current resource
configurations.<br>
<b>Cross Family Right Sizing</b> - Utilizing CPU and Memory metrics of the
current resource running, Vega Recommends migrating to resources in different
families and types to optimally size a resource for performance and cost.<br>
<b>Optimal Recommendation</b> - Based on the optimal performance, cost benefit,
and customer risk tolerances, Vega provides the optimal resource type from the
above recommendations.<br>
<br>
* Please note: when looking at CPU &amp; Memory metrics Vega utilizes a full
suite of metrics over the last 30 days, if a material portion of metrics are
missing or no metric data is available at all, Vega assumes 100% utilization
when making recommendations.</p>
